  While the history of the Paugusset people began long before the European encounter,

  the early written records are European accounts. They are one of the numerous Algonquian-speaking

  nations who emerged in the coastal areas of the Atlantic. Historically, they occupied a region from

  present-day Norwalk to West Haven, and from Long Island Sound inland for as far as they could navigate

  by canoe on the Housatonic and Naugatuck rivers. The tribe was made up of four primary sub-groups,

  the Paugussett Proper in what is present-day Milford, Derby and Shelton; the Pequonnock, along the coast;

  the Pootatuck in Newtown, Woodbury and Southbury; and the Weantinock in New Milford. They had a farming and

  fishing culture. The women cultivated varieties of staple crops: corn, beans, and squash, and tobacco, which

  was used for ritual purposes. The men fished in both fresh and salt water. The size of midden shell heaps

   along the coast and the amount of cleared land attested to both a long period of occupation and a high degree

    of social organization among the people.
